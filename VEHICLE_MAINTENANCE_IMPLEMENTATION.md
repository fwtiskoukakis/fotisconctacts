This document summarizes the vehicle maintenance tracking feature implementation as specified in the plan.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (✅ Complete)
**File:** `supabase/migrations/add-vehicle-maintenance-fields.sql`

Added fields to vehicles table:
- `last_service_date` (DATE) - Date of last service
- `last_service_mileage` (INTEGER) - Mileage at last service
- `next_service_mileage` (INTEGER) - Recommended mileage for next service

### 8. Navigation Integration (✅ Complete)
**File:** `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`

Updated FAB (Floating Action Button):
- "Νέο Οχημα" button navigates to `/add-edit-vehicle`
- "Συντήρηση" button navigates to `/maintenance` (new tab)

Context-aware actions on cars page:
- Add new vehicle
- View maintenance list
- Vehicle inspection

## User Flow

### Adding/Editing Vehicle with Maintenance Data
1. User taps FAB on Cars page → "Νέο Οχημα"
2. Fills out basic information (required fields marked with *)
3. Expands KTEO section, sets expiry date
4. Expands Insurance section:
   - Sets type (Basic/Full)
   - Toggles "Mixed Coverage" if applicable
   - Sets expiry date
5. Expands Tires section:
   - Records when tires were changed
   - Sets next recommended change date
6. Expands Service section:
   - Records last service date and mileage
   - Sets target mileage for next service
7. Taps "Αποθήκευση" (Save)

### Viewing Maintenance Status
1. User navigates to Cars tab
2. Vehicles with urgent maintenance show warning icon
3. Maintenance chips displayed below vehicle info
4. User can tap vehicle to see full details

### Using Maintenance List
1. User taps FAB → "Συντήρηση" or navigates to Maintenance tab
2. Views all vehicles sorted by selected criterion (default: KTEO)
3. Sees color-coded urgency for each maintenance item
4. Taps sort button to change sorting:
   - KTEO expiry
   - Tire change due
   - Insurance expiry
   - Service due
5. Taps vehicle card to view/edit details

## Technical Details

### Color Coding System
- **Red (#FF3B30)**: Expired or Critical (≤7 days / ≤500km)
- **Orange (#FF9500)**: Warning (≤30 days / ≤1000km)
- **Yellow (#FFCC00)**: Soon (≤60 days / ≤2000km)
- **Green (Colors.success)**: OK (>60 days / >2000km)
- **Gray (Colors.textSecondary)**: Not set

### Date Handling
- Uses `date-fns` for all date operations
- Proper timezone handling
- Greek locale formatting (el)
- ISO 8601 format for database storage

### Database Considerations
- All new fields are nullable for backward compatibility
- Existing vehicles without maintenance data work normally
- Indexes on key date fields for fast sorting
- Proper data types (DATE for dates, INTEGER for mileage, BOOLEAN for flags)

### Performance
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Urgency calculations done in memory (not database)
- Minimal re-renders with proper React hooks
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Migration Steps

To deploy this feature:

1. **Run Database Migration:**
   ```bash
   # Apply the migration file
   supabase migration up add-vehicle-maintenance-fields.sql
   ```

2. **No Code Changes Needed:**
   - All TypeScript interfaces updated
   - Service layer handles new and old data structures
   - UI gracefully handles missing data

3. **Gradual Data Population:**
   - Users can add maintenance data as they edit vehicles
   - No requirement to fill all fields immediately
   - System works with partial data
