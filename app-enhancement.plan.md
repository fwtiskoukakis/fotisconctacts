# FleetOS Enhancement Plan

## Analysis Summary

After analyzing the entire codebase, I've identified significant opportunities for improvement across UI/UX, business features, and technical architecture.

**Current State:**

- Strong foundation with Supabase integration (mostly complete)
- Modern design system (iOS 26 liquid glass) partially implemented
- Advanced services built but underutilized (CustomerService, FinancialService, FleetService, ReportingService)
- Basic analytics with no visualizations
- Dark mode infrastructure exists but disabled
- Some legacy file system dependencies remain
- No image optimization or caching strategies

---

## PRIORITY 1: UI/UX Design Improvements

### 1.1 Enable Dark Mode

**Files:** `contexts/theme-context.tsx`, `utils/brand-colors.ts`, all screen files

- Currently forced to light mode only (line 39, 54, 63 in theme-context)
- FleetOSDarkTheme already exists but unused
- Add theme toggle in profile settings
- Apply dark mode colors across all screens
- Test contrast ratios for accessibility

### 1.2 Enhanced Analytics Dashboard

**File:** `app/(tabs)/analytics.tsx`

- Implement:
- Revenue trend line chart (last 6 months)
- Vehicle utilization pie chart
- Top performing vehicles bar chart
- Monthly comparison cards

### 3.7 Code Architecture Improvements

**Refactoring opportunities:**

- Extract repeated logic into custom hooks:
