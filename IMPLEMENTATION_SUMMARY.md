# FleetOS Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### 1. Dark Mode Disabled
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

- App now forces light theme only
- All theme toggle buttons removed from UI
- Theme context updated to always return light theme
- Changes in:
  - `app.json`
  - `contexts/theme-context.tsx`
  - `components/app-header.tsx`
  - `components/bottom-tab-bar.tsx`
  - `components/fleetos-logo.tsx`

### 2. Contract Observations Field Added
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  

New field for adding notes/observations to contracts.

**Database Changes:**
- SQL migration file created: `supabase/add-observations-and-vehicles.sql`
- Added `observations TEXT` column to `contracts` table
- Updated full-text search to include observations

**Code Changes:**
- Updated `models/contract.interface.ts` - added `observations?: string`
- Updated `models/database.types.ts` - added observations to all contract types
- Updated `services/supabase-contract.service.ts` - mapping and save functions

**Usage:**
```typescript
contract.observations = "Œ†ŒµŒªŒ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ∂ŒÆœÑŒ∑œÉŒµ ŒµœÄŒπœÄŒªŒ≠ŒøŒΩ Œ±œÉœÜŒ¨ŒªŒµŒπŒ±";
```

### 3. Vehicles Table Created
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

Comprehensive vehicles table with full maintenance tracking.

**Features:**
- Basic vehicle info (make, model, year, plate, category, color)
- KTEO (MOT) tracking (last date, expiry date)
- Insurance tracking (type, expiry, company, policy number)
- Tire tracking (front/rear dates and brands)
- Vehicle status (available, rented, maintenance, retired)
- Maintenance notes

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/add-observations-and-vehicles.sql` - SQL schema
- `models/vehicle.interface.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `services/vehicle.service.ts` - Complete CRUD service
- Updated `models/database.types.ts` - Added vehicles table types

**Available Functions:**
- `VehicleService.getAllVehicles()`
- `VehicleService.getVehicleById(id)`
- `VehicleService.getVehicleByPlate(licensePlate)`
- `VehicleService.createVehicle(vehicle)`
- `VehicleService.updateVehicle(id, updates)`
- `VehicleService.deleteVehicle(id)`
- `VehicleService.getVehicleDamageHistory(licensePlate, limit)`
- `VehicleService.getVehicleSummary(licensePlate)`
- `VehicleService.getVehiclesWithExpiringDocuments(daysAhead)`
- `VehicleService.searchVehicles(query)`

### 4. Contract Status Fix (Time-Aware)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

Contracts now consider both date AND time when determining status.

**Problem:** A contract with dropoff at 17:00 today was showing as "completed" at 10:00.

**Solution:** Updated `calculateStatus()` in `services/supabase-contract.service.ts` to parse and compare full datetime including hours and minutes.

**Example:**
- Contract: Pickup 2025-10-22 09:00, Dropoff 2025-10-22 17:00
- Current time: 2025-10-22 10:00
- Old behavior: Status = "completed" ‚ùå
- New behavior: Status = "active" ‚úÖ

### 5. Add New Car Fixed for Supabase
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

The "Add Vehicle" functionality now works with Supabase's vehicles table.

**Changes:**
- Updated `app/fleet-management.tsx`
- Now uses `VehicleService` instead of old `FleetService`
- Properly maps form fields to new vehicle schema
- Gets `user_id` from authenticated user instead of `organization_id`

**Result:**
Users can now successfully add new vehicles through the Fleet Management screen.

## Remaining Tasks üöß

### 6. Show Last Damages on Vehicle Details
**Status:** Pending

When viewing vehicle details, show a list of previous damages from past contracts.

**Implementation:**
Use `VehicleService.getVehicleDamageHistory(licensePlate, 20)` to fetch and display.

### 7. Auto-populate Vehicle Data in New Contract
**Status:** Pending  

When user types a license plate in "New Contract", auto-fill vehicle details and show previous damages.

**Implementation Plan:**
```typescript
// In app/new-contract.tsx
const handleLicensePlateChange = async (plate: string) => {
  const vehicle = await VehicleService.getVehicleByPlate(plate);
  if (vehicle) {
    setMake(vehicle.make);
    setModel(vehicle.model);
    setYear(vehicle.year);
    // Load damages
    const damages = await VehicleService.getVehicleDamageHistory(plate);
    setExistingDamages(damages);
  }
};
```

### 8. Change Vehicles Display to Grid
**Status:** Pending

Currently vehicles show in a list. Need to change to grid layout with cards.

**Design:**
- 2 columns on phone, 3-4 on tablet
- Each card shows: photo, make/model, plate, status badge
- Tap to view details

### 9. Migrate Photos to Supabase Storage
**Status:** Pending

Move all damage/contract photos to Supabase Storage buckets.

**Steps:**
1. Create storage buckets (`contract-photos`, `damage-photos`)
2. Set up RLS policies
3. Create `PhotoStorageService`
4. Update photo capture component to upload to storage
5. Store URLs in `photos` table

---

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration

Open your Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
supabase/add-observations-and-vehicles.sql
```

This will:
- Add `observations` field to contracts
- Create the `vehicles` table
- Create helper functions and views
- Set up proper indexes and RLS policies

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created

Run this query to verify:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('contracts', 'vehicles', 'damage_points', 'photos');
```

You should see all 4 tables.

### Step 3: Test Adding a Vehicle

1. Open the app
2. Navigate to Fleet Management (or wherever you can add vehicles)
3. Click "Add Vehicle"
4. Fill in required fields:
   - Make (required)
   - Model (required)
   - License Plate (required)
   - Year
   - Category
5. Add optional fields:
   - KTEO dates
   - Insurance info
   - Tire info
6. Click Save

### Step 4: Test Contract Observations

1. Create or edit a contract
2. You should see a field for "Observations" or "Notes"
3. Add some text
4. Save the contract
5. View the contract to verify observations are saved

### Step 5: Test Contract Status

1. Create a contract for today
2. Set pickup time to morning (e.g., 09:00)
3. Set dropoff time to evening (e.g., 17:00)
4. View the contract at different times during the day
5. Verify status changes correctly:
   - Before 09:00: "upcoming"
   - Between 09:00-17:00: "active"
   - After 17:00: "completed"

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue:** "Error adding vehicle"
- **Solution:** Make sure you ran the SQL migration first
- **Solution:** Check Supabase logs for RLS policy errors
- **Solution:** Verify user is authenticated

**Issue:** "Table vehicles does not exist"
- **Solution:** Run the SQL migration in Supabase SQL Editor

**Issue:** "Contract still shows completed when it shouldn't"
- **Solution:** Make sure pickup_time and dropoff_time are stored in HH:mm format
- **Solution:** Check the contract data in Supabase to verify times are correct

**Issue:** "Can't see observations field"
- **Solution:** Run the SQL migration
- **Solution:** Update the app code to show the observations field in contract forms
