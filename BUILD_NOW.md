# 🚀 Build Your Android App - Quick Guide

## ✅ Your App is Ready to Build!

All code is complete and configured. You just need to run the build command in your own terminal.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open Your Terminal
- Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**
- Or use the **integrated terminal in VS Code** (Ctrl + `)

### Step 2: Navigate to Project
```bash
cd C:\Users\kasio\OneDrive\Documents\aade\fotisconctacts
```

### Step 3: Run Build Command
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### Step 4: Answer the Prompts

**When asked "Generate a new Android Keystore?"**
- Answer: **Y** (Yes)
- This creates signing keys for your app (only needed once)

**The build will then:**
- Upload your code
- Install dependencies
- Build the Android APK
- Give you a download link

## 📱 After Installation:

Test these features on your Android device:
1. Add a vehicle with KTEO/insurance dates
2. Create contract and type license plate
3. Watch it auto-fill make/model!
4. See previous damages count
5. Add observations to contract
6. View vehicle damage history

## Alternative: Build Locally

If you have Android Studio installed:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview --local
```

This builds on your computer instead of EAS servers (faster but requires Android SDK).
