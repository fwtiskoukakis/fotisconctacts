## 📋 Task 1: Add FAB (+ Button) to All Pages ✅

### **What Was Fixed:**
- Added Floating Action Button (FAB) to all main pages
- FAB appears on: Contracts, Damages, Cars, Homepage, etc.

### **How It Works:**

### **Actions Available:**

- **Homepage:** Multiple quick actions

**File:** `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`, `components/context-aware-fab.tsx`

## 📋 Task 2: Fix Damages Detail Page ✅

### **What Was Fixed:**
- Created NEW dedicated `damage-details.tsx` page
- Updated `damage-report.tsx` to navigate to damage details, NOT contract details

### **Before:**
- Clicking on damage → showed contract details ❌
- No way to see just damage information

### **After:**
- Clicking on damage → shows damage-specific details ✅
- Beautiful dedicated page with:
  - Severity badge (color-coded)
  - Vehicle information
  - Damage location and description
  - Timestamp
  - Actions: "View Contract" and "Edit"

**Files:** 
- **NEW:** `app/damage-details.tsx`

- Displays actual PNG images:
  - `car_conditions.png`
  - `scooter-conditions.png`
  - `atv-conditions.png`

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Much clearer for users

2. **Damage Details** → "Επεξεργασία" button → Navigates to contract ✅
3. **Car Details** → "Επεξεργασία" button → Shows alert (edit car page TBD) ✅

4. Click an action → navigate to creation page
```

## 📝 Notes

### **For Future Development:**

1. **Car Edit Page:** Currently shows alert, needs dedicated page
2. **Vehicle Type Persistence:** Optionally save vehicle type selection to contract
3. **More Vehicle Types:** Easy to add (just add new images)
4. **PDF Images:** For better vehicle diagrams in PDF, consider:
   - Base64 encoding images
   - Using a PDF library that supports images better
   - Current text-based solution works well for printing

### **Known Limitations:**

1. **PDF on Web:** Opens in new window (browser's print dialog)
2. **Vehicle Diagrams in PDF:** Text-based (not images) for compatibility
3. **Car Edit:** Placeholder alert (edit car page not yet created)
