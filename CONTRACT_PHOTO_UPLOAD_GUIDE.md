# Contract Photo Upload & Gallery - Complete Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the complete implementation of contract photo upload and gallery functionality using Supabase Storage and database integration.

## üì± Test Page

A comprehensive test page has been created at: `app/contract-photo-upload-test.tsx`

### Access the Test Page

1. Open the app
2. Navigate to **Settings** tab (‚öôÔ∏è)
3. Scroll to **üß™ Developer / Test** section
4. Tap on **üì∏ Contract Photo Upload Test**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components

1. **Test Page**: `app/contract-photo-upload-test.tsx`
   - Full-featured test interface for photo upload
   - Camera and gallery picker
   - Photo preview
   - Upload to Supabase Storage
   - Gallery view of uploaded photos

2. **Service Layer**: `services/photo-storage.service.ts`
   - Upload contract photos
   - Upload car/vehicle photos
   - Upload damage photos
   - Upload signatures
   - Delete photos
   - List photos
   - Save/retrieve photo metadata

3. **Reusable Component**: `components/photo-capture.tsx`
   - Production-ready photo capture component
   - Can be integrated into any contract page

### Database Schema

#### `contract_photos` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.contract_photos (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
    contract_id UUID REFERENCES public.contracts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    photo_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    photo_type TEXT CHECK (photo_type IN ('pickup', 'dropoff', 'damage', 'general')) DEFAULT 'general',
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Supabase Storage Buckets

1. **contract-photos**: For contract-related photos
2. **car-photos**: For vehicle photos
3. **signatures**: For signature images

## üöÄ Features

### 1. Photo Capture
- **Camera**: Take photos directly with device camera
- **Gallery**: Select photos from device gallery
- **Multi-select**: Select multiple photos from gallery at once
- **Permissions**: Automatic permission handling

### 2. Photo Preview
- View selected photos before upload
- Remove individual photos
- Clear all photos
- Visual indicators for uploaded photos

### 3. Upload to Supabase
- Upload to Supabase Storage (contract-photos bucket)
- Save metadata to database (contract_photos table)
- Support for different photo types (pickup, dropoff, damage, general)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Progress indicators

### 4. Gallery View
- Grid layout of uploaded photos
- 3-column responsive grid
- Tap to view full screen
- Photo descriptions
- Refresh functionality
- Empty state when no photos

### 5. Full Screen Viewer
- Tap any photo to view full screen
- Pinch to zoom (native Image component)
- Close button to return to gallery

## üìñ How to Use the Test Page

### Step 1: Enter Contract ID
- The page auto-generates a test contract ID
- Or enter your own contract ID
- Format: `TEST-CONTRACT-{timestamp}` or any valid UUID

### Step 2: Add Photos
- **Camera Button**: Opens camera to take a new photo
- **Gallery Button**: Opens gallery to select existing photos
- Can add multiple photos before uploading

### Step 3: Preview Photos
- All selected photos appear in a horizontal scrollable preview
- Each photo shows:
  - Thumbnail preview
  - Remove button (√ó)
  - Upload status checkmark (‚úì) after upload

### Step 4: Upload Photos
- Tap **"Upload to Supabase Storage"** button
- Photos are uploaded one by one
- Metadata is saved to database
- Success message shows number of uploaded photos

### Step 5: View Gallery
- Tap **"üîÑ Refresh"** in Gallery section
- All photos for the contract are loaded from database
- Photos are displayed in a 3-column grid
- Tap any photo to view full screen

### Additional Features
- **Clear All**: Remove all photos from preview
- **Test Connection**: Test Supabase connection
- **Remove Individual**: Tap √ó on any photo to remove it

## üîß Integration into Your App

### Method 1: Use the PhotoCapture Component

```typescript
import { PhotoCapture } from '../components/photo-capture';

export default function YourContractScreen() {
  const [photos, setPhotos] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const contractId = 'your-contract-id';

  function handlePhotoTaken(photoUrl: string) {
    setPhotos(prev => [...prev, photoUrl]);
  }

  return (
    <PhotoCapture
      onPhotoTaken={handlePhotoTaken}
      photos={photos}
      contractId={contractId}
      captureMode="photo"
    />
  );
}
```

### Method 2: Use the PhotoStorageService Directly

```typescript
import { PhotoStorageService } from '../services/photo-storage.service';
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

async function takeAndUploadPhoto() {
  // Take photo with camera
  const result = await ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync({
    mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
    quality: 0.8,
  });

  if (!result.canceled && result.assets[0]) {
    // Upload to Supabase
    const uploadResult = await PhotoStorageService.uploadContractPhoto(
      'contract-id',
      result.assets[0].uri,
      0 // photo index
    );

    // Save metadata to database
    await PhotoStorageService.savePhotoMetadata(
      'contract-id',
      uploadResult.url,
      uploadResult.path,
      uploadResult.size,
      0
    );

    console.log('Photo uploaded:', uploadResult.url);
  }
}

async function loadContractPhotos() {
  const photos = await PhotoStorageService.getContractPhotos('contract-id');
  console.log('Loaded photos:', photos);
}
```

### Method 3: Batch Upload

```typescript
import { PhotoStorageService } from '../services/photo-storage.service';

async function uploadMultiplePhotos(photoUris: string[], contractId: string) {
  const results = await PhotoStorageService.uploadContractPhotos(
    contractId,
    photoUris
  );
  
  console.log(`Uploaded ${results.length} photos`);
  return results;
}
```

## üîê Supabase Setup Required

### 1. Storage Buckets

Ensure these storage buckets exist in Supabase:

INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES 
  ('contract-photos', 'contract-photos', true),
  ('car-photos', 'car-photos', true),
  ('signatures', 'signatures', true);
```

### 2. Storage Policies

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload contract photos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'contract-photos');

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view contract photos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'contract-photos');
```

### 3. Database Policies

```sql
-- Allow users to insert photos for their contracts
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert contract photos"
ON public.contract_photos FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.contracts
    WHERE contracts.id = contract_photos.contract_id
    AND contracts.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Allow users to view photos for their contracts
CREATE POLICY "Users can view contract photos"
ON public.contract_photos FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.contracts
    WHERE contracts.id = contract_photos.contract_id
    AND contracts.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Photos not uploading?
1. Check Supabase connection: Use "Test Supabase Connection" button
2. Verify storage buckets exist
3. Check storage policies allow authenticated uploads
4. Check console for detailed error messages

### Photos not appearing in gallery?
1. Ensure you tap "Refresh" after uploading
2. Verify contract ID matches
3. Check database policies allow reading
